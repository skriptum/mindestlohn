# Notes

## Sonneberg

Sonneberg: - Germany's first AfD district administrator (Landrat) -
Robert Sesselmann - prevails in run-off election against conservative
CDU - 52.8% to 47.2%

shocking to political establishment, international coverage

Sonneberg also: district with the highest proportion of minimum wage
earners in DE - 2022 increase in minimum wage to 12 euros - 44% of
Sonneberg residents benefited from this - the highest in Germany

Research Question: What is the connection between minimum wage and
populism?

-   trade exposure (globalization)
-   financial crises
    -   austerity measures
    -   unfair perception of bailouts
-   MIgration
    -   economic fears (must not be rational)
    -   sudden influxes of many = more right wing
-   inequality
    -   perception of unfairness
    -   low intergenerail mobility

another overview by @gurievPoliticalEconomyPopulism2022

-   trade
    -   exposure to low wage industrial competition
    -   especially in rural regions (cities could protect from impacts
        with service industry)
-   economic crisis
    -   austerity
    -   redistribution
-   cultural backlash
-   immigration
    -   shock immigration of 2015 syrian refugee crisis
    -   higher perception than reality
-   also emigration (esp. eastern europe)
    -   good ground for populist vote of the remaining

### Economic Drivers

Literature on economic drivers presented above, but on german / european district level

@gabrielPoliticalCostsAusterity2023

regional Database on political costs of austerity

-   fiscal austeritiy =\>
    -   higher share for extreme parties
    -   lower vote turnout
    -   1% reduction =\> 3% increase vote
-   austerity driven recession =\> even more
    -   lower trust in government
    -   special of just recession

@dippelEffectTradeWorkers2022 : Trade in Germany Populist

-   case study germany Effect of Trade on Workers and Votes
-   low skilled manufacturing workers = votes responsive to trade
    exposure
-   level of Landkreise in Germany
-   have interesting dataset on trade exposure in the counties

@alesinaIntergenerationalMobilityPreferences2018

-   lower intergenerational mobility
-   higher rpreference for redistributional policy
-   differences in perception

### Sociodemographic Driver Populism

@pickelWahlAfDFrustration2019: Sozialstrukturelle Analyse

-   self identify class: lower class & working class & middle class
    -   real: mostly workers and Facharbeiter
    -   also some lower state servants (Beamte)
-   no age / income differences to general population

@hoevermannUmfragehochAFD2023: Sociodemografic Factors and Work

-   more temporary workers (befristet)
-   bad working conditions = lower esteem of work
-   uncontempt with current wage
-   lower share of workers council (Betriebsrat)

### Cultural Drivers

- not only economic explanations, also cultural / identity politics
- activated by economic shocks

@cantoniPersistenceActivationRightwing2019

- municipalities with nazi history 1933 = stonger support today
- AfD = party platofrm with low social stigma

### Literature on Minimum Wage and Politics

@zavodnyPoliticalEconomyMinimum2020a

-   political economy of minimum wages
-   focuses mostly on height of MW in different countries
    -   influencing factors on it

focus more general on labor market policies in general and support for populist vote @bergmanLabourMarketPolicies2022

- loss of status as driver


## Data

Vote Share AfD:
[Bundeswahlleiter](https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/bundestagswahlen/2021/ergebnisse/bund-99.html)

-   calculated for the different Landkreise, not Wahlbezirke
-   Parliament Election on 09/2021

Minimum Wage: [Wirtschaft- und Sozialwissenschaftliches Institut (Hans
Böckler
Stiftung)](https://www.wsi.de/de/sonderauswertung-43368-mindestlohnanhebung-43374.htm)

based on:

-   BA Arbeit
-   Destatis
-   SOEP

=\> extrapolated by WSI

-   "sozialversicherungspflichtig beschäftigte" in district
-   part / full time, not MiniJob
-   projected for 01/10/2022

additional Data

-   Regionalstatistik des Bundes und der Länder
-   Regionatlas for Geodata

## Method

Linear Regressio with OLS Estimator

$$
\text{afd}_k = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{min}_k + \epsilon
$$

-   $\text{afd}_k$ AfD Vote Share in Landkreis $k$
-   $\text{min}_k$ Share of Minimum Wage Recipients in Landkreis $k$
-   $\beta_0$ Intercept
-   $\beta_1$ Slope
-   $\epsilon$ Error

## Results

basic Model

-   Estimated Coefficient = 0.7
-   statistically significant
-   R2 = 0.61

=\> 1% increase in MW recipoients =\> 0.7% increase in AfD share

Model with Eastern German Dummy

-   as visible on electoral Maps = eastern Germany more right wing vote
    share
-   dummy for ost (1 = eastern, 0 = not)
-   coefficient lower = 0.3
-   but still significant
-   R2 increase = 0.74

additional controls

-   not significant in all specificiations
-   do not change R2 much
-   no real impact
-   unemployment rate,
-   log GPD per Cap
-   log pop. density
-   foreigners rate
-   age

Test for Wahlergebnis of left poplist party (Die LINKE)

-   some way yes
-   but not really significant
-   as described by Piketty = left today not really "abgehängte"

## Theory

Populism = multicausal, not only socioeconomic, but also
sociodemographic, cultural, ...

i want to explain where MW fits exisitng research

status disordance [@kurerDisappointedExpectationsDownward2022]

-   connected to eastern germany & minimum wage
-   MW = lower status than expected from parents with stable jobs in GDR
-   also generally disappointed by it

MW recipients = workers at lower end of spectrum

-   instability of job = insecurity [@hoevermannUmfragehochAFD2023]
-   wish back good old times with stable jobs pre neoliberalism

despise for inequality [@bartelsTopIncomesGermany2019]

-   lower end of wage scale (feels like down)
-   disappointed by system
-   see inequality
-   inequality =\> populism

lack of social mobility [@dodinSocialMobilityGermany2021] adn
[@alesinaIntergenerationalMobilityPreferences2018]

-   if high share of MW = not many higher paying jobs
-   esp. eastern germans = not many high earning positions
-   future pessimism = easier for populists

eastern germany [@snowerCaringHandThat2006]

-   hard hit by post-Wende turmoil
-   creation of Niedriglohnsektor due to TreuHand policy
-   cultural factors as well

inflation [@toberHaushaltspezifischeTeuerungsraten2022]

-   hits lower wage workers harder
-   especially rural regions with high share of card dependency

why only now, not earlier?

-   Voice Exit by [@hirschmanExitVoiceLoyalty1972]
-   before, exit (abstention) only option for voters incontempt with
    situation
-   with rise of AfD = voice

labor market hypothesis?

-   mostly rejected empirically
-   because rationally no risk of losing job (low unempl. share)
-   but maybe irrational fear

Afd position on MW

-   before 2015 introduction = "jobkiller" by chef petry
-   changed away from this towards a more social-nativist standpoint
-   "Grundsatzprogramm" supports MW concept

### future Research

-   characteristics of MW jobs
-   panel data set with more than one point in time

## Implications

not stop from higher MW!

Policy

-   union bargaining incerase for higher wages
-   european "richtlinie" 80%
-   increase social mobility + decrease east west inequality
