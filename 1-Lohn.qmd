# Notes

## Sonneberg

Sonneberg: - Germany's first AfD district administrator (Landrat) -
Robert Sesselmann - prevails in run-off election against conservative
CDU - 52.8% to 47.2%

shocking to political establishment, international coverage

Sonneberg also: district with the highest proportion of minimum wage
earners in DE - 2022 increase in minimum wage to 12 euros - 44% of
Sonneberg residents benefited from this - the highest in Germany

Research Question: What is the connection between minimum wage and
populism?

### Overview Papers Economic Drivers

@fischerEconomicDeterminantsPopulism2023 (DIW)

-   trade exposure (globalization)
-   financial crises
    -   austerity measures
    -   unfair perception of bailouts
-   MIgration
    -   economic fears (must not be rational)
    -   sudden influxes of many = more right wing
-   inequality
    -   perception of unfairness
    -   low intergenerail mobility

another overview by @gurievPoliticalEconomyPopulism2022

-   trade
    -   exposure to low wage industrial competition
    -   especially in rural regions (cities could protect from impacts
        with service industry)
-   economic crisis
    -   austerity
    -   redistribution
-   cultural backlash
-   immigration
    -   shock immigration of 2015 syrian refugee crisis
    -   higher perception than reality
-   also emigration (esp. eastern europe)
    -   good ground for populist vote of the remaining

### Economic Drivers

Literature on economic drivers presented above, but on german / european district level

@gabrielPoliticalCostsAusterity2023

regional Database on political costs of austerity

-   fiscal austeritiy =\>
    -   higher share for extreme parties
    -   lower vote turnout
    -   1% reduction =\> 3% increase vote
-   austerity driven recession =\> even more
    -   lower trust in government
    -   special of just recession

@dippelEffectTradeWorkers2022 : Trade in Germany Populist

-   case study germany Effect of Trade on Workers and Votes
-   low skilled manufacturing workers = votes responsive to trade
    exposure
-   level of Landkreise in Germany
-   have interesting dataset on trade exposure in the counties

@alesinaIntergenerationalMobilityPreferences2018

-   lower intergenerational mobility
-   higher rpreference for redistributional policy
-   differences in perception

### Sociodemographic Driver Populism

@pickelWahlAfDFrustration2019: Sozialstrukturelle Analyse

-   self identify class: lower class & working class & middle class
    -   real: mostly workers and Facharbeiter
    -   also some lower state servants (Beamte)
-   no age / income differences to general population

@hoevermannUmfragehochAFD2023: Sociodemografic Factors and Work

-   more temporary workers (befristet)
-   bad working conditions = lower esteem of work
-   uncontempt with current wage
-   lower share of workers council (Betriebsrat)

### Cultural Drivers

- not only economic explanations, also cultural / identity politics
- activated by economic shocks

@cantoniPersistenceActivationRightwing2019

- municipalities with nazi history 1933 = stonger support today
- AfD = party platofrm with low social stigma


### position & status

@kurerDisappointedExpectationsDownward2022 Status Discrodance

- calculated expected status based on parents occupation
- and difference to achieved status in reality
- especially men and eastern german high discordance

also @brianburgoonPositionalDeprivationSupport2019

- positional deprivation = income growth relative to other influences vote 
- slow = retreat from mainstream parties = feeling of losing out

### Literature on Minimum Wage and Politics

@zavodnyPoliticalEconomyMinimum2020a

-   political economy of minimum wages
-   focuses mostly on height of MW in different countries
    -   influencing factors on it

focus more general on labor market policies in general and support for populist vote @bergmanLabourMarketPolicies2022

- loss of status as driver


## Data

Vote Share AfD:
[Bundeswahlleiter](https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/bundestagswahlen/2021/ergebnisse/bund-99.html)

-   calculated for the different Landkreise, not Wahlbezirke
-   Parliament Election on 09/2021

Minimum Wage: [Wirtschaft- und Sozialwissenschaftliches Institut (Hans
Böckler
Stiftung)](https://www.wsi.de/de/sonderauswertung-43368-mindestlohnanhebung-43374.htm)

based on:

-   BA Arbeit
-   Destatis
-   SOEP

=\> extrapolated by WSI

-   "sozialversicherungspflichtig beschäftigte" in district
-   part / full time, not MiniJob
-   projected for 01/10/2022

additional Data

-   Regionalstatistik des Bundes und der Länder
-   Regionatlas for Geodata

## Method

Linear Regressio with OLS Estimator

$$
\text{afd}_k = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{min}_k + \epsilon
$$

-   $\text{afd}_k$ AfD Vote Share in Landkreis $k$
-   $\text{min}_k$ Share of Minimum Wage Recipients in Landkreis $k$
-   $\beta_0$ Intercept
-   $\beta_1$ Slope
-   $\epsilon$ Error

## Results

basic Model

-   Estimated Coefficient = 0.7
-   statistically significant
-   R2 = 0.61

=\> 1% increase in MW recipoients =\> 0.7% increase in AfD share

Model with Eastern German Dummy

-   as visible on electoral Maps = eastern Germany more right wing vote
    share
-   dummy for ost (1 = eastern, 0 = not)
-   coefficient lower = 0.3
-   but still significant
-   R2 increase = 0.74

additional controls

-   not significant in all specificiations
-   do not change R2 much
-   no real impact
-   unemployment rate,
-   log GPD per Cap
-   log pop. density
-   foreigners rate
-   age

Test for Wahlergebnis of left poplist party (Die LINKE)

-   some way yes
-   but not really significant
-   as described by Piketty = left today not really "abgehängte"

## Discussion

Populism = multicausal, not only socioeconomic, but also
sociodemographic, cultural, ...


### my argument:

Minimum Wage is one of the channels translating abstract phenonema to populist vote:

phenomena  / factors (from literature):

- financial crisis
- austeritiy
- trade exposure

lead to: Minimum Wage / Low Wage sector

equals:
- lack of mobility
- status discordance
- general disappointment (inequality etc)

=> leads to populist voting

### factors: 

- financial crisis
    - shwon by @nauIncomePrecarityFinancial2019
    - crisis hits low income and middle income
    - creates income precarity
    - higher risk for insecuritry for all groups

- austerity
    - especially in euro-crisis @buschEuroCrisisAusterity
    - destruction of collective bargaining etc.
    - creates low wage sector 

- trade exposure
    - as shown by @utarWorkersFloodgatesLowWage2018
    - manufacturing workers => instable low wage service jobs

### channels

- lack of mobility
    - @dodinSocialMobilityGermany2021] adn
[@alesinaIntergenerationalMobilityPreferences2018]
    - if high share of MW = not many higher paying jobs
    - esp. eastern germans = not many high earning positions
    - future pessimism = easier for populists

- status discordancy @kurerDisappointedExpectationsDownward2022
    - MW = lowest status possible (except unemployed)
    - comparison to parent generation with higher status
        - either because east german = more middle class, compressed wage scale
        - pre financial crisis times = more job stability etc.

- positional deprivation @brianburgoonPositionalDeprivationSupport2019
    - rising share of top 10% @bartelsTopIncomesGermany2019
    - but not fast rising MW (except for 12 increase, but not much more)
    - lower end of wage scale (feels like down)
    - disappointed by system
    - see inequality
    - inequality =\> populism

- additional: instability of job, fear of losing joba nd being unemplyoed ling

### Controls

why minimum wage, not general low wage sector

- of course, MW kind of proxy for low wage sector
- but is additional psychological (very far end of wage scale)
- nobody below you (except unemployed)
- far away from high pay jobs of "winners" 


why vote for AfD, not Linke?

- shown by @berghExplainingRisePopulism2022, that unemployment = left, insecure job = right
- Linke = more for privileged voters (piketty)
- AfD more effective, much attention on them in public discourse


why now, not earlier?

- party changed attitude towards MW
    - earlier: jobkiller
    - now: important social policy (Grundsatzprogramm)
- social acceptance of Afd: Exit (Abstention) --> Voice
    - following @hirschmanExitVoiceLoyalty1972
- also: Inflation now hits very hard (2020f)
    - @toberHaushaltspezifischeTeuerungsraten2022
    - especially low wage in rural regions


endogeneity: Afd -> MW?

- not in power anywhere except Sonneberg and small districts
    - MW rise was before    
    - not long in power
- no change in economic structure there


labor market hypothesis?

- rejected (unemployment share not relevant)
- but may still have a place as irrational fear

Visualization of Theory:
```{mermaid}
%%{init: {'theme': "neutral"}}%%
graph LR

A([Financial Crisis]) & B([Austerity]) & C([Trade exposure]) --> MW((Mininum Wage))

A & B & C -.- O[... other Channels]

MW --- D[Lack of mobility] & E[Status Discordance] & F[Positional Deprivation]
--> AfD((Populist voting))
O -.-> AfD
```


### other channels:

eastern germany

-   hard hit by post-Wende turmoil, [@snowerCaringHandThat2006]
-   creation of Niedriglohnsektor due to TreuHand policy
-   cultural factors as well 
-   @mauLuettenKleinLeben2019 vast sociological study (shows difference)

inflation [@toberHaushaltspezifischeTeuerungsraten2022]

-   hits lower wage workers harder
-   especially rural regions with high share of car dependency


### future Research

-   characteristics of MW jobs
-   panel data set with more than one point in time

## Narrative Case Example: Sonneberg

## Conclusion

not stop from higher MW!

Policy

-   union bargaining incerase for higher wages
-   european "richtlinie" 80%
-   increase social mobility + decrease east west inequality
